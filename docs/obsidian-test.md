# Obsidian Test Document

This is a test of how documents appear in Obsidian's interface.

## Links and Tags
We can use:
- Standard markdown links like [Basic Memory](basic-memory)
- Tags like #test #documentation 
- Embeds like ![[basic-memory]]

## Features to Test
### Knowledge Graph
This document should show up in the knowledge graph with connections to:
- [[Basic_Memory]] project
- [[Knowledge_Graph_Structure]] which implements it
- [[Development_Process]] that guides it

### Backlinks
Any document that links to this one should appear in the backlinks panel.

### YAML Frontmatter
Obsidian should display the frontmatter cleanly at the top of the document.

### Code Blocks
```python
def test_function():
    """Code blocks should have syntax highlighting"""
    print("Testing display")
```

### Callouts
> [!NOTE] 
> Obsidian supports special callout blocks
> They help organize important information

### Task Lists
- [x] Create test document
- [x] Add various markdown features
- [ ] View in Obsidian
- [ ] Check graph visualization
